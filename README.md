Challenge: Backbone Students
============================

A frontend framework challenge.


## Project Description

You'll find a JSON file adjacent to this read me file.  The JSON includes multiple students, their class schedules and teachers.  Using this data, your goal is to build an interface giving users the ability to view and filter class schedules in various ways.  Feel free to add any upgrades, unit tests, etc to improve this app.

At minimum users must be able to: 
 - Select a single student and see a full class schedule for that student
 - Select multiple students to see which classes they'll attend together

Frameworks: 
Preference given to jQuery, BackboneJS, Handlebars, Bootstrap, Jasmine (use any or all)
